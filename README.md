# Personal Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. The goal of this website is to showcase my current web development and design work, as well as some photography.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- TypeScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
